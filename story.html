        <div class="title">My Story</div><br> <br>
        <div class="story"> It all started one day when I was sitting with my maternal uncle, scrolling through YouTube
            shorts and watching videos. We stumbled across a video of someone from the Associate Android Developer team
            visiting someone's home and giving out certificates and appreciation. I was inspired by this and decided to
            do some research to find out more about Android and how Android apps are made. <br> <br>

            I soon discovered that the things we do on our phones and laptops are done by coding, and I became
            interested in coding and programming languages. My maternal uncle told me about my other cousin maternal
            uncle is software engineer and he have good experience in software development field. We both contacted him and
            he suggested that if we wanted to learn coding and explore this field, We should purchase a laptop. <br>
            <br>

            I asked my parents to buy me a laptop so I could learn coding in a smooth way. After waiting for two or
            three months, I finally got a good laptop and I started learning python first but at that time I am not able
            to understand their code syntax so I started fully from basic that's why I learnt HTML at the first.After
            HTML,I learnt CSS and JavaScript.And now,I am proficient in these technolgies. Currently I am learning
            node.js for backend development <br> <br>

            Today, <span class="underline">I am a successful front-end web developer and the founder of CodeINBlogs.</span> I am now famous and have
            been featured in several online news outlets. I hope my story inspires others to pursue their dreams and
            never give up. <br> <br> <address style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">—Anshul Soni {Age: 12 Y/O}</address><br>
